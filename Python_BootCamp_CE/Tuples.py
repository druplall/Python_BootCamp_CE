# Tuples are very similar to list however they have one key difference "Immutability"
# Once an element is inside a tuple, it can not be reassigned. 
# Tuple use parenthesis: (1,2,3)

t = (1,2,3)
my_list = [1,2,3]

print(type(t))
len(t)

t = ('one',2)

print(t[0])

# Tuples have two built in methods
# Count and index
